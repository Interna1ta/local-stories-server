# Agora

Agora is a microblogging service that I started this project as the final project of [Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp](www.ironhack.com/).

## Technologies

For the backend (this repository) I used Express generator, and some packages.

For the frontend [Client](https://github.com/Interna1ta/local-stories-client) I used Angular CLI as a project generator and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) to style.

The local database was [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/), and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a local server.
And [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) as a cloud platform for the deployment.

## Try the app on Chrome and Mozilla Firefox(not available on Safari, yet...)
